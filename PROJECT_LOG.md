## Project Overview
A private web application that leverages AI to extract, summarize, and organize multimedia content transcripts with intelligent processing and collaborative management tools.

### Tech Stack
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Express.js backend
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- OpenAI integration for content processing
- Authentication system with admin capabilities

## Progress Log

### April 5, 2025 - Initial Development

#### Completed Features
- âœ… Built core summarization functionality using OpenAI API
- âœ… Implemented authentication system with user/admin roles
- âœ… Added invitation system for new user registration
- âœ… Implemented data separation so users can only view their own summaries
- âœ… Fixed invitation token validation with improved URL parsing
- âœ… Modified database schema to add user_id column to summaries table

#### Current Implementation Details
- First registered user automatically becomes an admin
- Invitation system generates unique tokens for new users
- Each user can only access summaries they generated
- Admin console allows user management

#### Pending Tasks
- ðŸ”„ GitHub integration for version control
  - Attempted to configure Git remote using personal access token
  - Need to verify Git setup and push initial code
- ðŸ”„ Testing admin functionality with multiple users
- ðŸ”„ Optimize screenshot extraction and processing

#### Next Steps
1. Complete GitHub repository connection
2. Review overall application architecture
3. Implement any remaining features (markdown export, etc.)
4. Prepare for deployment

## Technical Notes

### Database Schema Evolution
- Added user_id to summaries table with backward compatibility
- Made user_id nullable to support existing records

### Authentication Flow
- Registration/login through auth page
- Invitation-based user creation through admin console
- Password reset on first login via invitation link

### AI Integration
- Using OpenAI GPT-4o for transcript summarization
- Structured output for key points, summary sections
