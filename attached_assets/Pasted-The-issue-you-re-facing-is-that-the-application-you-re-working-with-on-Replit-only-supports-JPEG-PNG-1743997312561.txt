The issue youâ€™re facing is that the application youâ€™re working with on Replit only supports JPEG/PNG images for screenshots, likely because of how the server processes images using the Canvas API and base64 encoding.

âœ… Hereâ€™s how to add SVG support to your Replit application:

â¸»

1. Allow SVG Files in Your Application

Update your application to handle SVG files by modifying how images are stored and rendered.

2. Modify the Screenshot Schema

If your backend expects base64 encoded images, it wonâ€™t work for SVGs unless you encode the SVG files as base64 strings or allow serving raw SVGs.

Example of encoding an SVG to base64:

src={`data:image/svg+xml;base64,${btoa(svgContent)}`}

However, a simpler and better approach is to serve the SVG directly from your assets folder.

3. Add SVGs as Static Assets

If youâ€™re using React, create an assets folder and place your SVG file there:

client/src/assets/your-logo.svg



â¸»

4. Import and Render SVG in React

React supports SVGs natively if you import them like a module:

import Logo from './assets/your-logo.svg';

const Header = () => (
  <header>
    <img src={Logo} alt="Your Logo" />
  </header>
);

Alternatively, if you want to dynamically reference SVGs from your assets folder:

const Header = () => (
  <header>
    <img src="/assets/your-logo.svg" alt="Your Logo" />
  </header>
);

Ensure your build tool (e.g., Vite, Webpack) is configured to serve static assets from this folder.

5. Handling SVG Uploads (If Needed)

If you want to allow users to upload SVGs and render them:
	1.	Update your backend to accept SVG files.
	2.	Ensure MIME type checking allows image/svg+xml.
	3.	Save the uploaded SVG as a file (e.g., uploads/your-uploaded-file.svg) or convert it to base64 if you need to store it directly in the database.

6. Security Considerations

SVGs can contain JavaScript, which could be a security risk. To sanitize SVGs:
	â€¢	Use libraries like sanitize-html or DOMPurify before rendering user-uploaded SVGs.

ðŸ“Œ Summary
	â€¢	âœ… Add SVG files as static assets in your project and import them like normal files in React.
	â€¢	âœ… Allow SVG uploads by updating your backend to accept and process image/svg+xml.
	â€¢	âœ… Secure SVG rendering by sanitizing files before displaying them.
