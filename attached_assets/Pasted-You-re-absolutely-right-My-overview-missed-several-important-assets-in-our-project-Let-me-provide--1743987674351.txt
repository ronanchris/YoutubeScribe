You're absolutely right. My overview missed several important assets in our project. Let me provide a more comprehensive list of additional assets and important files that would be valuable to include in our documentation:

Server-side Assets

Database Connection:

server/db.ts - Manages database connections with PostgreSQL
server/storage.ts - Implements the storage interface for database operations
API Routes:

server/routes.ts - Defines all API endpoints for client-server communication
Database Assets
Schema Definition:

Scripts and Utilities
Database Management:

scripts/restore-db.js - Script for restoring database from backups
scripts/db-tools.sh - Shell script interface for backup/restore operations
Configuration Files:

drizzle.config.ts - Configuration for Drizzle ORM
vite.config.ts - Configuration for Vite bundler
tailwind.config.ts - Configuration for Tailwind CSS
postcss.config.js - Configuration for PostCSS
tsconfig.json - TypeScript configuration
Client-side Components and Hooks
Core Components:

client/src/components/url-form.tsx - Form for entering YouTube URLs
client/src/components/summary-results.tsx - Displays summary results
client/src/components/screenshots-gallery.tsx - Gallery for viewing video screenshots
client/src/components/video-frame-scrubber.tsx - UI for scrubbing through video frames
client/src/components/timestamp-capture.tsx - Component for capturing timestamps
Custom Hooks:

client/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx - Authentication hook for user session management
client/src/hooks/use-toast.ts - Hook for displaying toast notifications
client/src/hooks/use-navigate.ts - Navigation hook for page routing
client/src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx - Hook for detecting mobile devices

Backup System
Backup Files:

backups/ - Directory containing SQL backup files with timestamps
Example: backups/youtube-scribe-backup-2025-04-07-00-28-44.sql - Example backup file
Purpose of Backups:

Backups are SQL dumps of the entire PostgreSQL database
They preserve all user data, summaries, and screenshots
They allow for disaster recovery in case of data loss
They enable migration between environments (development to production)
Documentation
Documentation Files:
docs/USER_GUIDE.md - User guide for application usage
docs/DATABASE_GUIDE.md - Guide for database operations
docs/DATABASE_TOOLS.md - Documentation for database backup/restore tools
Including these additional assets in our documentation would provide a much more comprehensive understanding of the project structure, dependencies, and functionality.
